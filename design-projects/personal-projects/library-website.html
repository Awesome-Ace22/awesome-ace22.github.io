    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Library Management System project, developed as part of the MIE 243 course, aimed to create a user-friendly
        web application for managing library resources efficiently. The project involved designing and implementing
        features such as user authentication, book catalog management, and borrowing/returning functionalities. The
        final product was a fully functional web application that streamlined library operations and enhanced user
        experience.</p>

    <h2>Experience Completing the Project</h2>
    <p>Working on this project was a comprehensive learning experience that involved both individual and collaborative
        efforts. The project required extensive use of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and a backend framework. Throughout the project, I engaged in various stages of the software development
        lifecycle, from initial planning and design to coding, testing, and deployment.</p>

    <p>The library page provided users with an intuitive interface to browse and manage books. This page was designed
        with user experience in mind, making it easy for users to find and borrow books.</p>

    <h2>Connection to Future Work/Career</h2>
    <p>This project directly aligns with my career aspirations in software development and engineering. The skills and
        experiences gained from this project are highly relevant to my future work, particularly in roles that involve
        full-stack development, project management, and user-centered design. The ability to create functional and
        efficient software solutions is a critical competency in the tech industry, and this project has significantly
        contributed to my proficiency in this area.</p>

    <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Developed a robust understanding of front-end and back-end web
            development, including the use of frameworks and libraries. These skills are essential for any software
            development role, enabling me to build and maintain web applications that meet user needs and industry
            standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Gained experience in managing a project from conception to completion,
            including task delegation, timeline management, and resource allocation. Effective project management is
            crucial in any engineering role, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within scope, and to a high
            standard of quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Worked closely with team members to achieve common goals, utilizing
            communication and collaboration tools to coordinate efforts and solve problems. Teamwork is a fundamental
            skill in the workplace, particularly in engineering and technology fields where projects often require
            multidisciplinary collaboration.</li>
