    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Autonomous Battlebot project was developed for participation in the Robowars competition. Robowars is an
        exciting competition where innovation, engineering, and competitive spirit collide. Participants design and
        build autonomous or remotely controlled robots to engage in intense battles. This event, hosted
        annually,provides a platform for both amateur enthusiasts and seasoned engineers to showcase their creativity
        and technical expertise. It emphasizes problem-solving, mechanical design, programming, and strategic thinking,
        making it a thrilling experience for participants and spectators alike.

        The objective was to design and build a fully autonomous robot capable of competing in a sumo-style battle,
        where the goal is to push the opponent's robot out of the arena. The project involved extensive mechanical and
        electrical design, as well as programming to ensure autonomous operation.

    <h2>Experience Completing the Project</h2>
    <p>This project was a challenging and rewarding experience that required a multidisciplinary approach. The design
        process included creating detailed sketches and CAD models, developing custom PCBs, and programming the robot's
        control system. The competition rules and constraints, such as size and weight limits, added an extra layer of
        complexity to the design process.</p>
