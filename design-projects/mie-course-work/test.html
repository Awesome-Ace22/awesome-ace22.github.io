    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In our second year of engineering, my MIE243 class was given the challenge of designing a beginner-friendly CNC machine tailored for hobbyist machinists.
        The aim was to address a gap in the market: a reliable, low-maintenance, and affordable CNC router with adequate
        precision for home-based projects involving wood, plastic, and aluminum. After extensive research, benchmarking,
        and iterative design processes, my team and I produced a functional and cost-effective design aligned with user needs. This
        project allowed us to explore engineering design rigor while integrating real-world considerations such as
        material selection, manufacturability, and usability.
