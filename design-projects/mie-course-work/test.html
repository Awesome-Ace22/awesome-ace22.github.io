    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In our second year of engineering, my MIE243 class was given the challenge of designing a beginner-friendly CNC machine tailored for hobbyist machinists.
        The aim was to address a gap in the market: a reliable, low-maintenance, and affordable CNC router with adequate
        precision for home-based projects involving wood, plastic, and aluminum. After extensive research, benchmarking,
        and iterative design processes, my team and I produced a functional and cost-effective design aligned with user needs. This
        project allowed us to explore engineering design rigor while integrating real-world considerations such as
        material selection, manufacturability, and usability.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience and Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>Completing this project was an enriching experience that honed my ability to work collaboratively in a
        multidisciplinary setting. From conceptualization to final design, the iterative design approach fostered
        critical thinking and problem-solving. Balancing cost constraints with technical specifications offered insights
        into the trade-offs inherent in engineering design.</p>

    <p><strong>Key components included:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing CAD models to simulate design performance.</li>
        <li>Exploring different motor systems and mechanical components to optimize performance.</li>
        <li>Refining the prototype to ensure it met safety, reliability, and ease-of-use criteria.</li>
    </ul>
