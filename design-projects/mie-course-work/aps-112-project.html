    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project aimed to design a cost-effective and user-friendly humidification system to maintain the relative
        humidity of a music room at optimal levels (40–50% RH) to preserve solid wood guitars. Collaborating with my
        team, we proposed and evaluated three design concepts, ultimately selecting the <strong>Autonomous Mist
            Diffuser</strong> as the final solution. This design uses ultrasonic technology to distribute moisture
        evenly, ensuring effective humidification while minimizing energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Precise control of humidity levels was achieved through careful integration of sensors, controllers, and power
        sources, as detailed in the <strong>electronics system diagram</strong>:</p>

    <h2>Connection to Future Work and Career</h2>
    <p>This project equipped me with the skills necessary for a career in mechanical and systems design, particularly in
        creating user-centered solutions. Working through challenges like balancing cost, usability, and scalability
        aligns closely with my goal of excelling in product development. These experiences also connect to my aspiration
        of innovating within robotics and aerospace industries, where integrating client needs with technical
        constraints is paramount.</p>

    <h2>Professional and Technical Skills Developed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Optimization and Analytical Decision-Making:</strong> Used tools such as the Pugh Method to
            evaluate and refine design concepts, achieving optimal performance within constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration and Communication:</strong> Worked effectively with team members and the client,
            using visual aids like CAD renderings and flowcharts to communicate complex ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability and Usability Awareness:</strong> Designed with energy efficiency and long-term
            usability in mind, aligning with sustainable engineering principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Outcomes and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Testing verified that the humidifier could achieve 40% RH in just 18 minutes and maintain it for over 14 days.
        Data trends modeled the efficiency of the ultrasonic mist generation and demonstrated cost savings of 55%
        compared to the client’s current solution.</p>

    <p>This project was a practical exercise in translating client needs into an engineered product, laying a foundation
        for future work in innovative, sustainable design within mechanical and systems engineering.</p>
