        As a member of UTAT Rocketry, I have been actively involved in the Propulsion, Avionics, and Software
        subsystems, contributing to the development of hybrid and liquid rockets. I have also worked on staging rocket technology
        and achieved my Tripoli Rocketry Association Level One Certification, showcasing my commitment to advancing my
        technical and practical expertise in mechanical engineering.
