        The University of Toronto Aerospace Team (UTAT) Rocketry Division is dedicated to designing, building, and
        launching cutting-edge high-power amateur rocket systems, competing in national and international competitions,
        and advancing rocketry innovation. Our projects include hybrid, solid, and liquid rockets, with an emphasis on
        pushing the boundaries of student-driven aerospace engineering.

        As a member of UTAT Rocketry, I have been actively involved in the Propulsion, Avionics, and Software
        subsystems, contributing to the development of hybrid and liquid rockets. I have also worked on staging rocket technology
        and achieved my Tripoli Rocketry Association Level One Certification, showcasing my commitment to advancing my
        technical and practical expertise in mechanical engineering.
