<div class="content-wrapper">    
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The Nova Software System is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage UTAT Rocketry's liquid propulsion systems. It integrates a React-based UI for telemetry visualization, a FastAPI backend for real-time data handling, and a C++ ground application for actuator and sensor control. Communication across components is streamlined using MQTT messaging, with deployment facilitated by Docker containers. A custom-configured DHCP server ensures seamless connectivity between ground systems and user interfaces, forming a robust network infrastructure.</p>
