    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Discovery is UTAT’s first liquid-propellant rocket designed to reach 10,000 ft, serving as a stepping stone for high-altitude liquid propulsion projects. With a custom oxidizer tank, engineering bays, and cold flow tests underway, Discovery aims to push the team’s expertise toward breaching the Kármán line.</p>
