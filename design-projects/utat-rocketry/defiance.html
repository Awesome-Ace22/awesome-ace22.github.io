    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Defiance is a hybrid-propellant rocket aiming to achieve altitudes of 30,000 ft and beyond. It features a nitrous oxide and paraffin wax hybrid propulsion system, a 10-ply carbon fiber fill bay, and precision-engineered recovery systems. In 2024, Defiance achieved a top speed of Mach 1.4 and an apogee of 30,500 ft, earning second place in Launch Canadaâ€™s Advanced Category.</p>
