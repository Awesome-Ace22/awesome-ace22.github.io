    <h1>Welcome to My Design Portfolio - General Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This portfolio is a showcase of my work and experiences as an aspiring engineer, reflecting my skills in design,
        problem-solving, and teamwork. It highlights a range of projects, from academic coursework to extracurricular
        initiatives like my contributions to UTAT Rocketry and Robowars. Each section demonstrates my ability to apply
        engineering principles to complex challenges and innovate through collaboration and creativity.

        The portfolio is not just a record of my achievements but a tool for personal and professional growth. It helps
        me articulate my competencies, explore career pathways, and connect my projects to my future goals. Whether used
        for job interviews, academic opportunities, or self-reflection, this collection of work represents who I am as
        an engineer and where I aim to go.
